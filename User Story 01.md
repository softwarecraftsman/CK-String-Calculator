# Summary
As an end-user, I want a calculator that will sum a string of numbers, so that I may caculate the sum of a list of numbers.

# Acceptance Criteria
- Calculator can accept 0, 1, or 2 numbers in a single string
- Calculator correctly sums the string of numbers
- Calculator calculates 0 for an empty string
- Numbers are separated by a comma ONLY; spaces not allowed

# Example Inputs and Outputs
- `"2,3"` =>	5
- `"5"`	=>	5
- `""`	=>	0

# Remember
- Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and 2 numbers
- Solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
- Refactor after each passing test
